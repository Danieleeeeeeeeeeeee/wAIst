**wAIst** is a research-driven Chrome extension that reveals the hidden environmental footprint of your AI usage.  
Every metric it reports—energy, carbon, and water—is grounded in peer-reviewed science, never guesswork.

## Features

As you interact with supported AI services, **wAIst automatically counts your queries** and translates them into tangible environmental impacts.  
You’ll see:

- how much energy (kWh) your AI usage consumes,  
- how much CO₂ (kg) it emits,  
- and how much water (L) is needed to power the underlying servers.  

All calculations adhere to methodology from the *Nature Sustainability* study—ensuring the numbers on your dashboard reflect real scientific models.

**everything runs locally**. Nothing is sent outside your browser.

## Research Integration

The research highlights how widely AI's footprint can vary depending on infrastructure and geography:

**Power & Water Efficiency**
- High-efficiency data centers: PUE ~1.1  
- Industry average: PUE ~1.58  
- Water use can be reduced by **85%** in optimized setups  

**Grid Intensity**
- Carbon intensity ranges from **0.12–0.38 kg CO₂/kWh**  
- Water intensity ranges from **1.5–2.5 L/kWh**  

**Projected Impact by 2030**
- **147–245 TWh** annual energy use  
- **24–44 Mt CO₂** emissions  
- **731–1,125 million m³** freshwater consumption  

Yet the study shows enormous mitigation potential:  
- **73% carbon reduction** with best practices  
- **86% water reduction** with optimized operations  

Regions such as **Texas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota** emerge as optimal locations for sustainable AI infrastructure due to favorable climate and grid makeup.

## How wAIst Uses the Research

Every number in wAIst is calculated using:
- PUE & WUE values directly from the study  
- Region-specific carbon and water intensity  
- Server lifetime, utilization rates, and allocation assumptions  
- Sensitivity-tested formulas validated against industry benchmarks  

This results in a **clear, personal dashboard** with:
- Monthly environmental totals  
- Per-service breakdowns  
- Region-adjusted impact estimates
